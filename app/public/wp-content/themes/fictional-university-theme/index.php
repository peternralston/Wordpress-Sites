This is our completely amazing custom theme.
This is a new commit from Peter's laptop. It was cloned from gitHub in the following manner
A clone was created from gitHub
the site was "zipped"
The zipped file was then 'drag and dropped' into the "local" (localwp app)
Then the local app was terminated
The unzipped file was deleted from the local sites folder
Then git bash recloned the original site from gitHub.
When the application (local) was restarted it was still connected the newly cloned site so both localwp and gitHub could track changes and have access to the site!!!
