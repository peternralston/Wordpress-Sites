This is our completely amazing custom theme.
Last night we added a local version of this site to my home laptop
But 'local' the wordpress app (localwp) could not see the cloned version from GitHub
even though it was in the same folder. 
So, I created a zip folder of the site to my desktop and drag and dropped the folder into the local app 
Then, I closed the app and deleted the folder. 
After it was deleted I did a git clone into the same folder. This way both the app and github were connected to the changes in the site!
Pesto! I did it. 

Only now I am having trouble loggin into GitHub when doing a git push to the repository. 
Lets see if I can git push these changes!
